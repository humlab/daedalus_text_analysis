    "- Fits users with different tech skills, some researcher wants to understand and be able to tune the logic.\n",
    "- Supports Python, that has big ecosystem of (open source) software libraries.\n",

It is marked as **In []** if it hasn't been executed, and as **In [n]** when it has been executed(n is an integer). A cell marked as **In [\\*]** is either executing, or waiting to be executed (i.e. other cells are executing).\n",

    "- The next cell will automatically be selected (made current) after a cell has been executed. Repeatadly pressing **shift+enter** or the play button hence executes the cells in sequence.\n",

To some extent, black-box use is unavoidable, but this emphasizes the need of a proper validation process. The Jupyter Notebook helps transferring some of these decisions from the tech specialist to the end user i.e. the researcher. It is of great advantage - and a signum of the Python ecosystem - that so many proven and battle-tested open source frameworks and tools exists.\n"
